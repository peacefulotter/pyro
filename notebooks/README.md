## ðŸ““ Notebooks

Check out the notebooks for examples using pyro. In particular, you can find:
- **[Iris](https://github.com/peacefulotter/pyroml/blob/main/notebooks/iris.ipynb)** : Simplest example training a small MLP on the Iris dataset.
- **[Distillation on Flowers102](https://github.com/peacefulotter/pyroml/blob/main/notebooks/distill-resnet18-flowers102.ipynb)** : Distillation of Resnet18, a residual CNN, on a much smaller network comprising of X parameters, trained on the Flowers102 dataset and reaching a test accuracy of .%.
- **[SmolVLM on Flowers102](https://github.com/peacefulotter/pyroml/blob/main/notebooks/smolvlm-flowers102.ipynb)** : Features from [SmolVLM](https://github.com/huggingface/smollm) vision model are extracted and used to train a linear classifier on the Flowers102 dataset, reaching a test accuracy of 98.6%.


### Note
> these notebooks do not intend to reproduce SOTA performances, but are included to showcase what can be accomplished with pyro and help you get started on your projects.
